You\'ll likely need to familiarize yourself with how DOS extenders work.  Grab the free version of IDA Pro (5.5 I think) that still supports MZ analysis.  Get a copy of DOSBox with the built-in debugger.  DOSBoxX is supposed to have better debugging than the regular flavor but I haven\'t tried it.\n\nWith IDA you do static analysis and annotation.  With DOSBox you do dynamic run-time analysis.\n\nOther things that helped were to get a copy of the OpenWatcom source code (which many DOS games were compiled with) and try and do standard library function matching with the c library it provides.\n\nMSDOS reversing is definitely a slog but with enough time and patience it can be done.'

            'Definitely brush up on your X86 knowledge, especially when it comes to segments and offsets in relation to memory addressing.  You\'ll likely need to familiarize yourself with how DOS extenders work.  Grab the free version of IDA Pro (5.5 I think) that still supports MZ analysis.  Get a copy of DOSBox with the built-in debugger.  DOSBoxX is supposed to have better debugging than the regular flavor but I haven\'t tried it.\n\nWith IDA you do static analysis and annotation.  With DOSBox you do dynamic run-time analysis.\n\nOther things that helped were to get a copy of the OpenWatcom source code (which many DOS games were compiled with) and try and do standard library function matching with the c library it provides.\n\nMSDOS reversing is definitely a slog but with enough time and patience it can be done.'
